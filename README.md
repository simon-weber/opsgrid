## Opsgrid has been shut down

Opsgrid was a simple hosted server monitoring service that stored data in users' Google Sheets.
The [old homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20210119181448/https://www.opsgrid.net/) has more information.

It worked reasonably well, but I didn't want to maintain it after moving to a more sophisticated setup.

The code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/simon-weber/opsgrid) along with some technical details, in case it's useful.
